# Privacy-Preserving Recommendation for Location-Based Services with Fully Homomorphic Encryption

Implementation of the protocol with the functions:
1. Compute aggregate information concerning user behavior patterns homomorphically while maintaining the privacy of individual users. 
2. Encrypted database update.

# Prerequisites
* CentOS 7.3
* Linux Kernel 3.10.0
* glibc 2.17
* g++ 4.8.5
* cmake >=2.8
* [HElib](https://github.com/shaih/HElib)
* doxygen (If you generate a document)

# Building
1. Build [HElib](https://github.com/shaih/HElib), then you copy the HELib top directory to `/usr/local/src/HElib`.
2. Run following command to build the library.
    ```sh
    $ mkdir build && cd build
    $ cmake ..
    $ make
    ```

# Demo
Demo app consists of three processes: PSP, PPRS and Client(Target User). These processes communicate as shown in the following figure.

![](doc/img/lbsr_flow.png)

## PSP demo app
* Behavior
    * If the `-g` option is specified, PSP generates a Public Key file with the file name specified by` pubkey_filename` and a Secret Key file with file name specified by `seckey_filename`. (Fig: (1))
    * PSP receives public key request from Client, then return the public key to Client. (Fig: (2))
    * PSP receives encryped location info from Client. (Fig: (4'))
    * PSP receives result request from Client, then decrypt recommendation list and retrieve location info and return the result to Clinet. (Fig: (8))
* Usage
    ```sh
    Usage: ./psp [-p pubkey_filename] [-s seckey_filename] [-g]
    ```
    * -p pubkey_filename : file path of public key file (REQUIRED)
    * -s seckey_filename : file path of secret key file (REQUIRED)
    * -g : if this option is specified, it generates a public Key file and a secret Key file. (OPTINAL)
* State Transition Diagram

## PPRS demo app
* Behavior
    * PPRS sends public key request to PSP, then receives the public key from PSP and save it named `pubkey.txt`. (Fig: (2'))
    * PPRS generates a co-occurrence matrix file named `enc_cooccurrence.txt`. (Fig: (3'))
    * PPRS receives encryped user preference from Client and save it named 'enc_preference.txt`. (Fig: (4))
    * PPRS receives compute request from Client, then compute recommendation and send the result to PSP. (Fig: (5)(6))
* Usage
    ```sh
    Usage: ./pprs [-i input_filename]
    ```
    * -i input_filename : file path of input data (REQUIRED)
* State Transition Diagram
  * ![](doc/img/lbsr_pprs_state.png)

## Client demo app
* Behavior
    * Client sends public key request to PSP, then receives the public key from PSP and save it named `pubkey.txt`. (Fig: (2))
    * Client encrypts the user preference specified by `input_filename`, then Client sends encrypted data to PPRS. (Fig: (3)(4))
    * Client sends encrypted location info to PSP. (Fig: (4'))
    * Client sends result request to PSP, then receives the result from PSP and write it to stdout. (Fig: (8))
* Usage
    ```sh
    Usage: ./client [-i input_filename]
    ```
    * -i input_filename : file path of input data (REQUIRED)
